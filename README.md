# Trading Control
A Rimworld Mod, hosted on the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2007107588)


### What it does.
Trading Control has expanded since it's first inception, being a simple place to direct traders, and stop them trampling over your colony!

Trading Control now allows you to manage your local Visitors and Traders more effectively.
- Designate a Trading area around a simple trade marker.
- Create a Marketplace stall and gain trading buffs for supporting these independant traders.
- Designate Orbital Supply drop locations, so they at least go near your Colony!
- Dismiss Traders and Visitors when you no longer want them around.

## Bonus 
Backwards compatible, up to version 1.0 of RimWorld, though some features are not available. (Also Odysey is awesome, why are you not playing it?)

## Save Compatible
Freely add and remove it whenever you need to.
