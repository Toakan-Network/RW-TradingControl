Trading Control has expanded since it's first inception, being a simple place to direct traders, and stop them trampling over your colony!

Trading Control now allows you to manage your local Visitors and Traders more effectively.
- Designate a Trading area around a simple trade marker.
- Create a Marketplace stall and gain trading buffs for supporting these independant traders.
- Designate Orbital Supply drop locations, so they at least go near your Colony!
- Dismiss Traders and Visitors when you no longer want them around.

-------- Update 2025/09/03 --------------
I've been busy, this release has a lot of new features and improvements, exclusivley for 1.6.
- Re-added original Dismiss functions so it applies to Traders and Visitors alike.
- Added a Marketplace stall in place of the Trading Spot, allowing a more tailored experience if you want to build a dedicated trading area.
    This stall was designed and provided by Ailailou-fi, with my thanks!
- Added a Mood Buff / Trade Buff to the Marketplace, to encourage protecting the traders.
- Fixed the Orbital Drop Beacon, so it properly targets the designated drop zones.
- Fixed a bunch of issues with the settings.
- Made all of the above configurable in the Settings, to some degree.
- Updated Japanese translations, with thanks to Proxyer for his continued work.
- Refactored the entire codebase for improved performance and maintainability.
